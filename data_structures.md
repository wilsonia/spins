# Data structures

The data structures used to represent quantum states reflects the approach to quantum mechanics used and the program's control flow.

Standard -> piece-wise application of Born rule -> linked list of measurements (labeled "components")

Consistent histories -> mixed-state density matrix -> nested object of events
