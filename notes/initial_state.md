# Initial State

Configuring an initial state for this simulation requires subtle reasoning.

When leaving the oven, the electron's spin orientation is random in the classical sense. We do not attempt to record the electron's spin state inside the oven, as doing so would be impractically difficult. The randomness of the initial spin state is not a function of any quantum phenomena, but a function of our ignorance about the system. This is what is meant by "classical uncertainty".

Distinguishing these sources of uncertainty is difficult when learning quantum mechanics for the first time. When developing ideas about quantum systems and the inherent uncertainty of their physical variables, discussion of mixed states muddies the waters. In the examples in McIntyre CH1&2, this is circumvented by preparing definite states at an initial analyzer, and then measuring the spin again at a separate analyzer.

McIntyre mentions that the SPINS simulation's "random" option prepares a mixed state. There is no further discussion of mixed states.
