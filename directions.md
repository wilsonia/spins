# Directions

### Analyzers
 - Click on the spin-up (+) or spin-down(-) port of any analyzer to change its output to:
	 - another analyzer
	 - a magnet
	 - a counter
 - Click on the direction label (x,y,z,n) of an analyzer to change the direction of spin measurement
 - For the general direction (n), click on the theta and phi labels to open a slider and drag to any value between 0 and 2 * pi.
 	- theta is the polar coordinate
	- phi is the azimuthal coordinate

### Counters
 - Click on any counter to block it, ignoring that measurement result
 - Click on a blocked counter to remove that output entirely
 	- The single output is then a coherent superposition of both measurement results

### Magnets
- Click on the output port of any magnet to change its output to:
	- another magnet
	- an analyzer
	- a counter
- Click on the direction label (x,y,z,n) of an analyzer to change the direction of magnetic field
- For the general direction (n), click on the theta and phi labels to open a slider and drag to any value between 0 and 2 * pi.
 	- theta is the polar coordinate
 	- phi is the azimuthal coordinate

### Specifying magnet magnitude/duration
- The quantity (Larmor frequency • duration of interaction) is set by clicking on ωt and dragging the slider to any value between 0 and 2 * pi.
