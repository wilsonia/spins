# Directions

### Analyzers
 - Click on the spin-up (+) or spin-down(-) port of any analyzer to change its output to:
	 - another analyzer
	 - a magnet
	 - a counter
 - Click on the direction label (x,y,z,n) of an analyzer to change the direction of spin measurement
 - For the general direction (n), click on the theta and phi labels to open a slider and drag to any value between 0 and 2 * pi.
 	- theta represents the polar coordinate
	- phi represents the azimuthal coordinate

### Adding/removing magnets
 - Right click on the spin-up (+) or spin-down(-) port of any analyzer.
 - Right click on the output port of any magnet.

### Changing direction of spin measurement or magnetic field
 - Click on direction label (x,y,z,n) of any analyzer or magnet.

### Specifying a custom direction of spin measurement or magnetic field
 - Change direction on analyzer or magnet to 'n'. Click on the theta and phi labels to open a slider

### Specifying magnet magnitude
- The Larmor frequency of the magnet is set by clicking on omega and dragging the slider to any value between 0 and 2 * pi.
- The Larmor frequency is directly proportional to the magnetic field magnitude and the duration of the electron's interaction with the magnetic field.
